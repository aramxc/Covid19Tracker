# Covid19 Data Tracker

View App: https://covid19tracker-aramxc.herokuapp.com/

A component basedvweb application that tracks daily Covid19 Data in the US.

I do not take credit for creating this app froms scratch!

This project was based off a tutorial from JavaScript Mastery - I followed the tutorial step-by-step to attempt to understand the concepts presented. I plan to expand on the project with additional features on my own eventually.

## Project Goal

My goal for this project is to further develop my web development skills, become more familiar with React, and build a relevant web application using real time Covid19 Data.

I learned alot about asynchronous functions and promises in Javascript. With synchronous Javascript, your code is run and a result is returned as soon as the browser can do so. Because Javascript is run line by line, this can throw errors if the result is a large data file such as the data set I'll be using in this project. Asynchronous functions allow code to be run in the background. 

I also learned about React Hooks. Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy.

## Data 

I used real-time Covid19 data for this project, obtained using the free API from The COVID Tracking Project.

## Material - UI

I also implemented Material - UI, a React framework similar to bootstrap, but slightly more sophisticated. This made the styling a lot easier, with less CSS to write from scratch.
